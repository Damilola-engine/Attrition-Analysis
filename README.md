*Attrition Analysis*

This project demonstrates how to analyze employee attrition using Excel, focusing on calculating the attrition rate and visualizing trends over time.

*Project Overview*

In this project, I analyzed the total number of employees, the number of employees who exited, and the attrition rate over a defined period. The analysis was carried out using *Excel* for data manipulation, pivot tables, and data visualization.

 *Steps Taken*

1. Data Preparation:
   - Collected and cleaned employee data, including join and exit dates.

2. Pivot Table Creation:
   - Used Excel to create a Pivot Table summarizing the total number of employees, employees who left, and the attrition rate.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzed attrition across various periods and departments to identify patterns in employee turnover.

4. Data Visualization:
   - Created **Pie Charts**, **Line Charts**, and **Bar Charts** to visualize:
     - The proportion of existing employees vs. those who left.
     - Trends in attrition over time.
     - Comparison of attrition rates by department.

5. **Insights**:
   - The visualizations helped identify critical periods or departments with high attrition, enabling management to make data-driven decisions.

 Tools Used
- *Excel* (Pivot Tables, Data Analysis, Charting)

Conclusion
This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in data analysis, pivot tables, and visualization with Excel. It enhanced my ability to transform data into actionable insights for business decision-making.
